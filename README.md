# Village Hero
Village Hero is a 2D time-based strategy game that challenges players to save a vulnerable village from imminent danger.
The game was built by four students during CS4553 - Game Design, a class taught by Andy Nealen at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. It was created entirely with Unity.

# Playing it
Builds for the game can be found in the Builds folder. One one is available at the moment, which is the main build that was submitted at the end of the semester.
The game controls best using an **Xbox One controller** and was designed for a screen resolution of **1024 x 768** (select this on the Unity configuration screen that pops up before the game starts).
